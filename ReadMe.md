Talk: &ldquo;QTL mapping for phenotypes measured over time&rdquo;
----------------------------------------------------------------------

See it in action
[here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/talks/FunQTL)
(eventually).

These are slides for a talk I will give at a plant breeding symposium
at Kansas State University on 2 April 2013.

The slides were tested for Safari on a Mac and might look terrible in
some browsers. I have a lot more to learn about handling browser
differences.
