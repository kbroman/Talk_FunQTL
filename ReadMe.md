### Talk: &ldquo;QTL mapping for phenotypes measured over time&rdquo;

See it in action
[here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/talks/FunQTL).

These are slides for a talk I gave at a plant breeding symposium
at the [Department of Agronomy](http://www.agronomy.ksu.edu/) at
[Kansas State University](http://www.k-state.edu/) on 2 April 2013,
and then at the [Danforth Plant Science Center](http://www.danforthcenter.org/)
on 19 Feb 2014.

The slides were tested for Safari and Chrome on a Mac and might look
terrible in some browsers.
