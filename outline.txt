-7. phenotypes, genotypes

-8. fancier picture of phenotypes

-9. Fancy picture of QTL analysis of a single phenotype

-10. Fancy picture with randomized phenotype

-11. Permutation distribution of genome-wide maximum LOD

12. Methods for dealing with outcomes measured over time
   - Consider each time point individually
   - Consider each time point individually,
     and then combine the results across times
   - fit model and treat parameters as phenotypes
   - nonparmetric version; treat coefficients as phenotypes

-13. Fancy picture the LOD curves at each time point

14. Combining across time (methods)
