-8. fancier picture of phenotypes

-9. Fancy picture of QTL analysis of a single phenotype

-10. Fancy picture with randomized phenotype

-11. Permutation distribution of genome-wide maximum LOD

12. Methods for dealing with outcomes measured over time
   - Consider each time point individually
   - fit model and treat parameters as phenotypes
   - nonparmetric version; treat coefficients as phenotypes

-13. Fancy picture of that  (or maybe *just* do the fancy version?)

14. Simple methods of combining across time
