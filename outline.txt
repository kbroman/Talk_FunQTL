-7. fancier picture of phenotypes

-8. Fancy picture of QTL analysis of a single phenotype

-9. Fancy picture with randomized phenotype

-10. Permutation distribution of genome-wide maximum LOD

-11. Fancy picture the LOD curves at each time point

-12. Methods for dealing with outcomes measured over time
   - Consider each time point individually
   - Consider each time point individually,
     and then combine the results across times
   - fit model and treat parameters as phenotypes
   - nonparmetric version; treat coefficients as phenotypes
